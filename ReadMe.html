<h2>Pd-extended 0.43.4-extended</h2>
<p>Pd is a real-time, graphical programming language for media processing.  It provides an environment for audio analysis, synthesis, and processing, with a rich set of multimedia capabilities.  You can get Pd for Linux, Windows, MacOS X, BSD, or IRIX.</p>
<p>For more information, go to: <a href="http://puredata.info" target="pd">http://puredata.info</a></p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>To reset the default settings, and make sure that default libraries are loaded when Pd runs, go to the <b>Edit</b> menu, then <b>Preferences</b> and click on <b>Reset to Defaults</b>.
You can also reset to defaults by double-clicking <code>C:\Program Files\pd\bin\pd-settings.reg</code> to import the settings to the registry.  WARNING: this will overwrite any existing Pd preferences!</p>
<h3>ASIO4ALL</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.asio4all.com/" target="_blank">ASIO4ALL</a> is a cost-free <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Stream_Input/Output" target="_blank">ASIO</a> audio driver.  Is it highly recommended for use with Pd.  Download and install it, then when you launch Pd, choose the <strong>ASIO</strong> option from the <strong>Media</strong> menu.  Using ASIO4ALL should mean less crashes and troubles, as well as better audio performance.
